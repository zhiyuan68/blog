Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

This site was bootstrapped from the `create fumadocs` template, but instead of documenting
an API, it now focuses on sharing short updates and longer-form notes.

Because the content is powered by **Fumadocs MDX**, every post can freely combine Markdown,
React components and rich embeds. Try editing this file and running the development server
to see changes live:

```bash
npm run dev
```

From now on, new articles can be added by creating `.mdx` files inside the
`content/blog` directory. The metadata at the top of the file controls how the post is shown
on the homepage and in the Open Graph preview.

Enjoy blogging!
