When a new idea is ready to ship, run through this quick checklist:

1. **Write** the content in `content/blog/<slug>.mdx` and fill the frontmatter with a title,
   short description, publish date and optional tags.
2. **Preview** the page by running `npm run dev` and visiting the generated preview URL.
3. **Share** the article once you are happy with the result.

> Fumadocs automatically generates the Table of Contents and search index for every post
> thanks to the shared content source.

Happy writing!
